                <p>I am currently a PhD candidate in Sociology specializing in crime, cyberterrorism. My research interests
                    include technology and society, ethical AI, computational social
                    science, network analysis and natural language processing.</p>
    
                <p>My dissertation focuses on the application of AI in analyzing criminal behaviors. Specifically, focusing
                    on how the integration of crime theories, network science, NLP and machine learning techniques can be
                    applied to highlight terrorists use
                    of technologies.</p>
    
                <p>Tools and techniques include statistical and computational techniques such as social network analysis,
                    NLP/sentiment analysis, machine learning predictive models and qualitative methods for data analysis.
